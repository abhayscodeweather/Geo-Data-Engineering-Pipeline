# Geo-Data-Engineering-Pipeline
A Geo-Spatial Data Engineering Pipeline is a real-time, end-to-end system designed to collect, process, analyze, and visualize geographical and environmental data for early detecti  This project integrates satellite imagery, weather APIs, and historical geospatial data into a scalable and resilient data pipeline built and data engineering tools.
# geo-disaster-pipeline
This project implements an end-to-end data engineering pipeline to monitor, process, and analyze real-time geospatial and environmental data to predict and respond to natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, and wildfires. The system ingests data from APIs, sensors, and satellite imagery, processes it using distributed tools, and visualizes critical insights on a map-based dashboard.
